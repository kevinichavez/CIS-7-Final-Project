# CIS-7-Final-Project

# Project Description

This program is a viginere-cipher program that was designed to be able to accept user input of a message, and then encrypt that message with a user-inputted key. It is also capable of reversing decryption on those same messages, provided that the key entered exactly matches the one that was used in the initial encryption process. In both cases, the program will save its output in a log file for record-keeping purposes.

# Program Purpose

The purpose of this program, beyond simply encrypting and decrypting messages, is to help emphasize the importance of data security and confidentiality in an evolving digital landscape where it is becoming easier and easier for data to be stolen. It will hopefully get the user to both have a basic understanding of operational security, and also make them more aware of the importance of keeping their messages out of the hands of malicious actors.

# Usage Instructions

Run the program.
At the first menu, select whether you would like to encrypt or decrypt a message.
When prompted, enter the key phrase to be used for encrypting or decrypting the message.
	If decrypting a message, it will ask for the complete decrypted message to be inputted as well.
After the program has completed, it will display the result on screen and save the output to a log file named “output.log”.
Finally, the program will ask if you would like to encrypt or decrypt another message.
